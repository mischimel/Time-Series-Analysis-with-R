# Lecture 5 – Time Series Fundamentals

## 5.1 Introduction

### Exercise 5.1. Introduction

#### Exercise 5.1: Predictor Variables

Read the following case. List the possible predictor variables that might be useful, assuming that the relevant data are available.

Case: Car Fleet Company

A large car fleet company asks us to help them forecast vehicle resale values. They purchase new vehicles, lease them out for three years, and then sell them. Better forecasts of vehicle sales values would mean better control of profits; understanding what affects resale values may allow leasing and sales policies to be developed in order to maximize profits. The resale values are being forecast by a group of specialists. Unfortunately, they see any statistical model as a threat to their jobs, and are uncooperative in providing information. Nevertheless, the company provides a large amount of data on previous vehicles and their eventual resale values.

-   *Model or make of the car*

-   *Odometer reading (how many km)*

-   *Conditions of the cars*

-   *Leaser - Company the car was leased to*

-   *Colour of car*

-   *Date of sale/purchase*

### Self-Study 5.1. Introduction

#### Self-Study 5.1: Steps of Forecasting

For the case described in Exercise 5.1, describe the five steps of forecasting in the context of this project.

***1. Business Understanding and Problem Definition***

-   *The main stakeholders should be defined.*

-   *Everyone has been questioned about which way he or she can benefit from the new system.*

*In case of the fleet company probably the group of specialists was not recognized as stakeholders which led to complications in gathering relevant information and later in finding an appropriate statistical approach and deployment of the new forecasting method.*

***2. Data Understanding: Information Gathering and Exploratory Analysis.***

-   *Data set of past sales should be obtained, including surrounding information such as the way data were gathered, possible outliers and incorrect records, special values in the data.*

-   *Expertise knowledge should be obtained from people responsible for the sales such as seasonal price fluctuations, if there is dependency of the price on the situation in economy, also finding other possible factors which can influence the price.*

-   *Graphs which show dependency of the sale price on different predictor variables should be considered.*

-   *Dependency of the sale price on month of the year should be plot.*

***3. Data Preparation***

-   *Possible outliers and inconsistent information should be found (for example very small, zero or even negative prices).*

***4. Choosing and fitting models***

-   *A model to start from (for example a linear model) and predictor variables which most likely affect the forecasts should be chosen.*

***5. Evaluating a forecasting model***

-   *Predicting performance of the models must be evaluated.*

-   *The model should be changed (for example by transforming parameters, adding or removing predictor variables) and it's performance evaluated.*

*This should be done iteratively wit step 4 a few times until a satisfactory model is found.*

***6. Deploying a Forecasting Model***

-   *The appropriate software should be deployed to the company and relevant people should be educated how to use this software.*

-   *Forecasting accuracy should be checked against new sales. If necessary the model should be updated and then the deployed software.*

## 5.2 Time Series in R

### Exercise 5.2. Time Series in R

#### Exercise 5.2: Exploring tsibble Objects

1\. Explore the following 3 time series. (The data sets are all contained in the package tsibbledata.)

-   Use ? or help() to find out about the data in each series.

-   What is the time interval of each series?

-   Use autoplot() to produce a time plot of each series.

-   For the last plot, modify the axis labels and title.

```{r}
#install.packages("tsibbledata")

library(tsibbledata)
library(tsibble)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(fpp3) # needed for autoplot for tsibble
```

-   Bricks from aus_production

```{r}
head(aus_production)

help("aus_production")

interval(aus_production)
# The time interval is quarterly BUT help says half-hourly (?)

aus_production |> autoplot(Bricks) 
# An upward trend is apparent until 1980, after which the number of bricks being produced starts to decline. A seasonal pattern is evident in this data. Some sharp drops in some quarters can also be seen.
```

-   Lynx from pelt

```{r}
head(pelt)

help("pelt")

interval(pelt)
# Interval is yearly. Looking closer at the data, we can see that the index is a Date variable. It also appears that observations occur only on trading days, creating lots of implicit missing values.

pelt |> autoplot(Lynx)
# Canadian lynx trappings are cyclic, as the extent of peak trappings 
# is unpredictable, and the spacing between the peaks is irregular but approximately 10 years.
```

-   Close from gafa_stock.

```{r}
head(gafa_stock)

help("gafa_stock")

interval(gafa_stock)
# The time interval is daily (irregular)

gafa_stock |> autoplot(Close)
# Stock prices for these technology stocks have risen for most of the series, until mid-late 2018.
# The four stocks are on different scales, so they are not directly comparable. A plot with faceting would be better.

gafa_stock |>
  ggplot(aes(x=Date, y=Close, group=Symbol)) +
  geom_line(aes(col=Symbol)) +
  facet_grid(Symbol ~ ., scales='free')
# The downturn in the second half of 2018 is now very clear, with Facebook taking a big drop (about 20%) in the middle of the year. The stocks tend to move roughly together, as you would expect with companies in the same industry.
```

2\. Use filter() to find what days corresponded to the peak closing price for each of the four stocks in gafa_stock from package tsibbledata.

```{r}
gafa_stock |>
  group_by(Symbol) |>
  filter(Close == max(Close)) |>
  ungroup() |>
  select(Symbol, Date, Close)
```

### Self-Study 5.2. Time Series in R

#### Self-Study 5.2: Creating tsibble Objects

1\. The USgas package contains data on the demand for natural gas in the US.

-   Install the USgas package.

```{r}
#install.packages("USgas")
library(USgas)
```

-   Create a tsibble from us_total with year as the index and state as the key.

```{r}
head(us_total)
```

```{r}
help(us_total) # y = yearly total natural gas consumption in a million cubic feet by state or US aggregate

us_tsibble <- us_total %>% 
  as_tsibble(index=year, 
             key=state)
```

-   Plot the annual natural gas consumption by state for the New England area (comprising the states of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island).

```{r}
us_tsibble %>%
  filter(state %in% c("Maine", "Vermont", "New Hampshire", "Massachusetts",
                      "Connecticut", "Rhode Island")) %>%
  autoplot(y/1e3) +
  labs(y = "billion cubic feet")
```

2\. Download tourism.xlsx from GitHub and read it into R using readxl::read_excel().

-   Create a tsibble which is identical to the tourism tsibble from the tsibble package.

```{r}
library(readxl)

my_tourism <- readxl::read_excel("tourism.xlsx") %>% 
  mutate(Quarter = yearquarter(Quarter)) %>% 
  as_tsibble(
    index = Quarter,
    key = c(Region, State, Purpose, Trips)
  )
```

```{r}
head(my_tourism)
```

```{r}
head(tourism)
```

-   Find what combination of Region and Purpose had the maximum number of overnight trips on average.

```{r}
my_tourism %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  summarise(Trips = mean(Trips), .by=c(Region, Purpose)) %>% 
  filter(Trips == max(Trips))
```

-   Create a new tsibble which combines the Purposes and Regions, and just has total trips by State.

#### ???? who to combine Purpose and Region, when only the total trips by state

```{r}
state_tourism <- my_tourism %>% 
  group_by(State) %>% 
  summarise(Trips = sum(Trips)) %>% 
  ungroup()

head(state_tourism)
```

## 5.3 Visualizing Time Series

### Exercise 5.3. Visualizing Time Series

#### Exercise 5.3: Time Plots, Seasonal Plots and ACF Plots

1\. The aus_arrivals data set comprises quarterly international arrivals to Australia from Japan, New Zealand, UK and the US.

-   Use autoplot(), gg_season() and gg_subseries() to compare the differences between the arrivals from these four countries.

```{r}
head(aus_arrivals)
```

```{r}
aus_arrivals %>% 
  autoplot(Arrivals)

# Generally the number of arrivals to Australia is increasing over the entire series, with the exception of Japanese visitors which begin to decline after 1995. The series appear to have a seasonal pattern which varies proportionately to the number of arrivals. Interestingly, the number of visitors from NZ peaks sharply in 1988. The seasonal pattern from Japan appears to change substantially.
```

```{r}

aus_arrivals %>%  
  gg_season(Arrivals, labels = "both")

# The seasonal pattern of arrivals appears to vary between each country. In particular, arrivals from the UK appears to be lowest in Q2 and Q3, and increase substantially for Q4 and Q1. Whereas for NZ visitors, the lowest period of arrivals is in Q1, and highest in Q3. Similar variations can be seen for Japan and US.
```

```{r}
aus_arrivals %>%  
  gg_subseries(Arrivals)

# The subseries plot reveals more interesting features. It is evident that whilst the UK arrivals is increasing, most of this increase is seasonal. More arrivals are coming during Q1 and Q4, whilst the increase in Q2 and Q3 is less extreme. The growth in arrivals from NZ and US appears fairly similar across all quarters. There exists an unusual spike in arrivals from the US in 1992 Q3.
```

-   Can you identify any unusual observations?

    -   *2000 Q3: Spikes from the US (Sydney Olympics arrivals)*
    -   *2001 Q3-Q4 are unusual for US (9/11 effect)*
    -   *1991 Q3 is unusual for the US (Gulf war effect?)*

2\. The following time plots and ACF plots correspond to four different time series. Your task is to match each time plot in the first row with one of the ACF plots in the second row.

## Self-Study 5.3. Visualizing Time Series

#### Self-Study 5.3: Time Plots and White Noise

1\. Download the file tute1.csv from GitHub, open it in Excel (or some other spreadsheet application), and review its contents. You will find four columns of information. Columns B through D each contain a quarterly series, labelled Sales, AdBudget and GDP. Sales contains the quarterly sales for a small company over the period 1981-2005. AdBudget is the advertising budget and GDP is the gross domestic product. All series have been adjusted for inflation.

-   Read the data into R and store it in the variable tute1.

```{r}
tute1 <- readr::read_csv("tute1.csv")

head(tute1)
```

-   View the data set and convert it to time series.

```{r}
View(tute1)

mytimeseries <- tute1 %>% 
  mutate(Quarter = yearquarter(Quarter)) %>% 
  as_tsibble(index = Quarter)
```

-   Construct time plots of each of the three series.

    -   Hint: Consider using pivot_longer() and facet_grid().

```{r}
mytimeseries %>% 
  pivot_longer(-Quarter, names_to="Key", values_to="Value") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, y = Value, colour = Key)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(vars(Key), scales = "free_y")
```

```{r}
# Without faceting:
mytimeseries %>% 
  pivot_longer(-Quarter, names_to="Key", values_to="Value") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, y = Value, colour = Key)) +
  geom_line()
```

2\. The aus_livestock data contains the monthly total number of pigs slaughtered in Victoria, Australia, from Jul 1972 to Dec 2018.

```{r}
head(aus_livestock)
```

-   Use filter() to extract pig slaughters in Victoria between 1990 and 1995.

    -   Hint: Use the dplyr function between() to access the years between 1990 and 1995.

    -   Hint: The column Month is a time object of class yearmonth. You can access the year in a yearmonth object x by year(x).

```{r}
vic_pigs <- aus_livestock %>% 
  filter(Animal == "Pigs", 
         State == "Victoria", 
         between(year(Month), 1990, 1995))
head(vic_pigs)
```

-   Use autoplot() and ACF() for this data.

```{r}
vic_pigs %>% 
  autoplot(Count)

# Although the values appear to vary erratically between months, a general upward trend is evident between 1990 and 1995. In contrast, a white noise plot does not exhibit any trend.
```

-   How do they differ from white noise?

```{r}
vic_pigs %>%  
  ACF(Count) %>% 
  autoplot()

# The first 14 lags are significant, as the ACF slowly decays. This suggests that the data contains a trend. A white noise ACF plot would not usually contain any significant lags. The large spike at lag 12 suggests there is some seasonality in the data.
```

-   If a longer period of data is used, what difference does it make to the ACF?

```{r}
aus_livestock |>
  filter(Animal == "Pigs", State == "Victoria") |>
  ACF(Count) |>
  autoplot()

# The longer series has much larger autocorrelations, plus clear evidence of seasonality at the seasonal lags of 12, 24, ....
```
